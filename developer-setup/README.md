These are scripts that can make getting a working development up and running easier and more consistant.  

These have been tested and verified to work on a fresh install of Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS using VirtualBox.

	- gcc, g++, and make  
	- git  
	- vim  

After, you can run __setup.sh__, which installs:  
	- curl  
	- NodeJs  
	- Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

	- VS Code Salesforce Extension Pack  
	- The Salesforce CLI
